# Hamiltonian learning quantum magnets with dynamical impurity tomography
MultImp and SingleImp codes for Hamiltonian learning on quantum magnets

FILES

network_jupy.ipynb:
Contains the code for MultiImp and SingleImp neural networks. By changing intial parametes one can change between MultiImp and SingleImp models. 

paper_figures.ipynb:
Contains codes to replot the figures in the paper, as well as scatter plots for predictions under no-noise and noise of chi=1.0.
